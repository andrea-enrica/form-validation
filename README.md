This is a small project where I build a browser form which collects Email,
Country, Zip Code, Password and Password Confirmation fields. It use live
inline validation to inform the user whether a field is properly filled in
or not. The form doesn't actually submit, but it displays an error message
if the buttom is pushed with any active errors or unfilled required fields.
If all is well and the form is "submitted", it displays a high five.
